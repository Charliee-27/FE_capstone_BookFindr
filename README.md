Capstone Project Reflection
 
In my creation of this project I faced way more problems than I anticipated, and the solution to those problems was singular; to be precise, it was my mentality and how I view things. It will be evident if I tell someone that I did this project in less than 4 days from design to development to deployment.
 
I was stuck mentally, aspiring to submit something legendary and unique. Little did I know that my time was expiring üòû, so I read documentations and watched YouTube tutorials, only to see a notification in my email from ALX saying, ‚Äú[ACTION REQUIRED] Submit Your Capstone Project for Review Today!‚Äù That‚Äôs when I knew my time was up, and I had two options: to do the hard thing or just to give up.
 
So I went online to Google how to get started on a development project. Then I understood concepts like tutorial hell, but most importantly, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt alone with ideas that are not yet in any project. But what really got me started was when I came across this quote by Abraham Lincoln: ‚ÄúGive me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.‚Äù
 
That‚Äôs when I gathered courage, set a very tight calendar, and reduced my sleeping hours because I do hard things. The design part was easy, but the development part was not. It was easy because I‚Äôve been following Net Ninja, so I knew what to do, but my project lacked implementation. There are 3 main features that I planned in the design but never developed.
 
I am just glad I managed to complete the whole process in such a short time. Initially, I planned to use TanStack, fka React Query, to fetch data, handle pagination, and manage the state of the search results. Then, I realized that I could fetch data with useEffect combined with useParams.
 
I hope to improve the web app before the end of this month.
